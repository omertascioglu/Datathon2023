# Datathon2023
Datathon 2023, the second stage of the Data Marathon, which we organised with Google and the Entrepreneurship Foundation, 
is open to everyone who is dedicated to data science in Turkey and will have the chance to put what they have learned into practice!

BTK Academy has been offering various trainings on topics such as statistics, data science, data analysis, big data, machine learning,
deep learning, Python programming to all registered students through its online training portal for a long time. For students who have received these trainings and want to enter the field of data science, 
the 2023 Datathon was planned in cooperation with Google and Girvak. Our Datathon activity, the first of which was held in 2022, was published again in 2023 as open to everyone who is devoted to data science in Turkey.

The aim of Datathon is to provide an opportunity for students who are entering data science to put their theoretical knowledge into practice, 
as well as to allow industry professionals to test their knowledge. Within the BTK Academy, 
content to support our Datathon activity as well as all other information about data science is already available free of charge.

This competition aims to accurately predict the class of each sample data. The metric that will be used to measure the success of the competition will be accuracy.

Accuracy is a metric that measures how successfully a model can predict real-world data. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of correctly classified samples to the total number of samples.
